              Web Application Development describes the process of designing, building, testing
              and deploying web-based applications that will be installed on remote servers and 
              delivered to users via the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web Application Development is a collaborative effort between front-end and back-end
              developers, although some organizations employ full-stack developers that can fit into
              either role. Web Application Development also requires unique consideration when it comes
              to functional and non-functional testing and securing the host environment against 
              malicious cyber attacks.

            <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything
              from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
              Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM
              tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, 
              convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

              Different types of HTML Elements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Basic HTML Tags</strong></li>
              <p>These are tags that define the structure of an HTML document. It instruct the browser on how the 
                content must be organized separating the document title meta information and the main body. The 
                html tag marks the statrt and end of document, while the head and body contains specific parts.
                Some example of structure tags are doctype, html, head, body, title, etc.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Formatting</strong></li>
              <p>These tags cotrols how your text is displayed on your website and ensures that the content is
                visually appealing, organized and easy to read. Some of example are center, blockquote, abbr, 
                address, etc.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Forms and Input</strong></li>
              <p>
                These are interactive elements that collect user input. There are various tags such as form, input,
                label, button, action, etc. These tags lets you gather information from the user.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Images</strong></li>
              <p>
                This allows you to embedd images in HTML whether it was taken from the internet or it was uploaded.
                It can also let you control some of the attributes of the image. Some of the tags that are used are 
                src, alt, img, height, width, etc.
              </p>
              <li><strong>List</strong></li>
              <p>This defines your text and makes the document more organized. Here are some example of the tags: li,
                ul, ol, etc.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Tables</strong></li>
              <p>
                Tables are used to structure and present data in a clear and organized manner using rows and columns. 
                This also makes your document more readable and appealing. Some examples are tr, th, td, thead, colgroup,
                etc.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Style and Semantic</strong></li>
              <p>
                Style makes your webpage more presentable. For styling webpage, programmers mostly use CSS. When using CSS 
                you can define font sizes, colors, backgrounds, and layouts for heading, etc. On the other hand, semantics 
                makes your document understandable. It provides the structure and meaning of the content on a webpage. Some 
                examples of the tag used are: p, table, h1, li, etc.

              <li><strong>HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong></li>
              <p>
                It provides tags and attributes that define the various elements on a webpage such as headings, paragraphs,
                images, links, forms, and more. HTML5 is the lates version of HTML and it introduces new features and
                improvements over its predecessors. Some of the new elements include header, nav, article, section, and footer.
              </p>
              <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong></li>
              <p>
                CSS is used to style and layout the visual presentation of HTML documents. CSS is applied either internally
                within an HTML document, externally in a separate stylesheet file, or inline within HTML tags. CSS allows you
                to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements on a webpage.
              </p>
              <li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
              <p>
                JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive behavior on webpages. JavaScript is
                commonly used to create features like sliders, form validation, pop-up messages, etc. It can also manipulate
                the content and structure of HTML, handle user input, and communicate with servers.

          <article>
              <p>
                FlexBox is a comprehensive layout system. Not just a single property. It involves properties such as container(flex container) and children(flex items). While traditional layouts use block and inline flow, flexbox uses a "flex-flow" direction. This direction determines how items are laid out along
                main axis(row or columns) and a cross axis. Here are some of the terminologies: 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>main-axis - direction of the row/column along which flex items are arranged.</li>
                <li>main start-end - Where flex items start and end along the main axis.</li>
                <li>main size -  The width or height of a flex items depending on the main axis direction.</li>
                <li>cross-axis - The axis perpendicular to main axis, where allignment happens.</li>
                <li>cross start/end - Where flex  items start and end along the cross axis </li>
                <li>cross size -  The width or height of a flex item depending on the cross axis direction.</li>
              </ul>
    
              <h1><strong>Flexbox Properties</strong></h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Properties for the Parent</li>
                <p>display -  it defines the flex container; inline block depending on the given value. It enables a flexbox context for all its direct children.</p>
               <code>.container {
                display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
              }</code>
                <li>flex-direction</li>
                <p>This estalishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is a single direction layout concept.</p>
                <code>.container {
                  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
                }</code>
                <li>flex-wrap</li>
                <p>By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to 
                  wrap as needed with this property.
                </p>
                <code>.container {
                  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
                }</code>
                <li>flex-flow</li>
                <p>This is a shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container's
                  main cross and axis.
                </p>
                <code>.container {
                  flex-flow: column wrap;
                }</code>
                <li>justify-content</li>
                <p>This defines the allignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either
                  all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.
                </p>
                <code>.container {
                  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
                }</code>
                <li>align-items</li>
                <p>This defines the default behavior for the flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line.</p>
                <code>.container {
                  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;
                }</code>
                <li>align-content</li>
                <p>This aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual within the main axis.</p>
                --This property only takes effect on multi-line flexible containers, where flex wrap is set to either wrap or warp-reverse. A single-line flexible container is set to
                its default value, no wrap.
                <code>.container {
                  align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe;
                }</code>
                <li>gap, row-gap, column gap</li>
                <p>The gap property explicitly controls the space between flex items. It applies that spacing only between items not on the outer edge.</p>
                <code>.container {
                  display: flex;
                  ...
                  gap: 10px;
                  gap: 10px 20px; /* row-gap column gap */
                  row-gap: 10px;
                  column-gap: 20px;
                }</code>
                <h1>Properties for the Children(flex items)</h1>
                <li>order</li>
                <p>By default flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.</p>
                <code>.item {
                  order: 5; /* default is 0 */
                }</code>
                <li>flex-grow</li>
                <p>This defines the ability of the text to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the availbale space inside the flex container the itm should take up.</p>
                <code>.item {
                  flex-grow: 4; /* default 0 */
                }</code>
                <li>flex-shrink</li>
                <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.</p>
                <code>.item {
                  flex-shrink: 3; /* default 1 */
                }</code>
                <li>flex-basis</li>
                <p>This defines the size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length or a keyword.</p>
                <code>.item {
                  flex-basis:  | auto; /* default auto */
                }</code>
                <li>flex</li>
                <p>This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, like flex: 5;, that changes the flex-basis to 0%, so it’s like setting flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;.</p>
                 <code>.item {
                  flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
                }</code>
                <li>align-self</li>
                <p>This allows the default alignment to be overridden for invidual flex items.</p>
                <code>.item {
                  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
                }</code>
